# Cryptaborate (Final project submission for Siraj's DAPPS course)
Cryptaborate is a decentralized social media platform on the Ethereum blockchain. Cryptaborate will provide a means for project collaboration for artists.

#### Important Note: 
> This is a student final project submissionion and has been prepared solely for the purpose of informing potential contributors to the Cryptaborate ecosystem with a proposal for the direction the network will possibly take. This project is non-binding in all respects and does not create any legal obligation of any kind on any person or entity.

# Inspiration
In a day where creativity is being pushed from our schools due to funding issues, it is becoming more difficult to allow original artistic expression to not only be shared across society, but also created. There is a lot of talent out there that should not only be seen by the masses, but also act as inspiration for future artists. 

There is beauty in all our differences. In a day and age where we are too often told how we must act, look and behave, it is through artistic expression that the shackles are stripped and many singular voices have the means to touch others on so many different levels.  Often for that impact to be seen however, it takes more than one person. 

It is my hope that Cryptaborate can plant the seed and build the social platform necessary to allow emotion and creativity to be expressed as it should be. Cryptaborate can provide a means for those single voices to multiply into many and spread across the world to allow their visions to be shared as far as their dreams envisioned. 

I welcome you to join me on this social adventure ahead, where your projects can be dreamt and executed as you wished, through the power of this social media ecosystem.   More importantly, as the network grows in popularity you, as the user, have the power to influence the direction of the network through Cryptaborate tokens.

Let’s help free artistic expression and its place in our future and empower those single voices to be heard across the world.

-Daniel Krotov
